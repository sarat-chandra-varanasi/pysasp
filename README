PySasp : Generate Python programs from s(ASP) answer set programs
------------------------------------------------------------------

Installation
------------

1. Need to have SWI-Prolog in PATH 
2. Run make on the top level directory
3. Generated executable is pysasp

Usage: 
------
pysasp <input_file>

To save the file, use IO-redirection of bash environment

pysasp <input_file> >  <output_file>

Info
----
<input_file> is an Answer Set Program in a particular format
as outlined in the LOPSTR 2019 Paper

"Synthesizing Imperative Programs from Answer Set Programming
Specifications"

Parser for PySasp is based on the s(ASP) parser. s(ASP) 
is a Predicate Answer Set Programs that produces stable models
without grounding.

s(ASP) itself downloadable from: 
https://sourceforge.net/projects/sasp-system/
